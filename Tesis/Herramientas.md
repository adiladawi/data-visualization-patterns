### Herramientas para Desktop

*  **graphics: ** This package contains functions for ‘base’ graphics. Base graphics are traditional S-like graphics, as opposed to the more recent grid graphics () ^[1].
*  **lattice:** A powerful and elegant high-level data visualization system inspired by Trellis graphics, with an emphasis on multivariate data. Lattice is sufficient for typical graphics needs, and is also flexible enough to handle most nonstandard requirements ()^[2].
* **ggplot2 :** An implementation of the grammar of graphics in R. It combines the advantages of both base and lattice graphics: conditioning and shared axes are handled automatically, and you can still build up a plot step by step from multiple data sources. It also implements a sophisticated multidimensional conditioning system and a consistent interface to map data to aesthetic attribute ()^[3]. 

### Herramientas para Web

* **Plotly** for R is an interactive, browser-based charting library built on the open source JavaScript graphing library, plotly.js. It works entirely locally, through the HTML widgets framework ()^[4].
* **googleVis** R interface to Google Charts API, allowing users to create interactive charts based on data frames. Charts are displayed locally via the R HTTP help server. A modern browser with Internet connection is required and for some charts a Flash player. The data remains local and is not uploaded to Google ()^[5].
* **rCharts** rCharts is an R package to create, customize and publish interactive javascript visualizations from R using a familiar lattice style plotting interface()^[6].
* **Shiny** apps are easy to write. No web development skills are required ()^[7].
* **ggplot2** An implementation of the grammar of graphics in R. It combines the advantages of both base and lattice graphics: conditioning and shared axes are handled automatically, and you can still build up a plot step by step from multiple data sources. It also implements a sophisticated multidimensional conditioning system and a consistent interface to map data to aesthetic attribute()^[8].

Python
-------------------
### Herramientas para Desktop 

* **Matplotlib** is a python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. matplotlib can be used in python scripts, the python and ipython shell (ala MATLAB or Mathematica), web application servers, and six graphical user interface toolkits ()^[].
*  **Seaborn** is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
*  **VisPy** is a Python library for interactive scientific visualization that is designed to be fast, scalable, and easy to use. VisPy is a high-performance interactive 2D/3D data visualization library. VisPy leverages the computational power of modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) through the OpenGL library to display very large datasets()^[].
* **PyQtGraph ** Is a pure-python graphics and GUI library built on PyQt4 / PySide and numpy. It is intended for use in mathematics / scientific / engineering applications ()^[].
* **Chaco**  is a Python plotting application toolkit that facilitates writing plotting applications at all levels of complexity, from simple scripts with hard-coded data to large plotting programs with complex data interrelationships and a multitude of interactive tools. While Chaco generates attractive static plots for publication and presentation, it also works well for interactive data visualization and exploration ()^[].
* **Networkx** NetworkX is a Python language software package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and function of complex networks. With NetworkX you can load and store networks in standard and nonstandard data formats, generate many types of random and classic networks, analyze network structure, build network models, design new network algorithms, draw networks, and much more ()^[].


### Herramientas para Web

* **C3.js** is a newcomer in an ocean of similar tools. Built on the D3 visualization library, it enables developers to create reusable charts and provides ways to manipulate a chart after it appears on screen ()^[].
* **D3** allows you to bind arbitrary data to a Document Object Model (DOM), and then apply data-driven transformations to the document. For example, you can use D3 to generate an HTML table from an array of numbers. Or, use the same data to create an interactive SVG bar chart with smooth transitions and interaction ()^[].
* **Plotly** for R is an interactive, browser-based charting library built on the open source JavaScript graphing library, plotly.js. It works entirely locally, through the HTML widgets framework ()^[].
* **Bokeh** is a Python interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation. Its goal is to provide elegant, concise construction of novel graphics in the style of D3.js, and to extend this capability with high-performance interactivity over very large or streaming datasets ()^[].
