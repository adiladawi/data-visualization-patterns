*  **graphics: ** This package contains functions for ‘base’ graphics. Base graphics are traditional S-like graphics, as opposed to the more recent grid graphics ().
*  **lattice:** A powerful and elegant high-level data visualization system inspired by Trellis graphics, with an emphasis on multivariate data. Lattice is sufficient for typical graphics needs, and is also flexible enough to handle most nonstandard requirements.
* **ggplot2 :** An implementation of the grammar of graphics in R. It combines the advantages of both base and lattice graphics: conditioning and shared axes are handled automatically, and you can still build up a plot step by step from multiple data sources. It also implements a sophisticated multidimensional conditioning system and a consistent interface to map data to aesthetic attribute.

Python

* **Matplotlib** is a python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. matplotlib can be used in python scripts, the python and ipython shell (ala MATLAB or Mathematica), web application servers, and six graphical user interface toolkits.
*  **Seaborn** is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
*  **VisPy** is a Python library for interactive scientific visualization that is designed to be fast, scalable, and easy to use. VisPy is a high-performance interactive 2D/3D data visualization library. VisPy leverages the computational power of modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) through the OpenGL library to display very large datasets.
* **PyQtGraph ** Is a pure-python graphics and GUI library built on PyQt4 / PySide and numpy. It is intended for use in mathematics / scientific / engineering applications.
* **Chaco**  is a Python plotting application toolkit that facilitates writing plotting applications at all levels of complexity, from simple scripts with hard-coded data to large plotting programs with complex data interrelationships and a multitude of interactive tools. While Chaco generates attractive static plots for publication and presentation, it also works well for interactive data visualization and exploration.
