## Description

A tree diagram is a graphic representation of a strictly hierarchical structure, which describes a set of elements and their relations to each other. All elements of such a structure have family like relations to other elements, qualifying them on an higher, lower or equal level in the set’s hierarchy. One particular element (the root element) does not have any superior or equal elements(Behrens, 2008). 


## Required Data 

Use tree diagrams to display data that consist of several items which are ordered in a hierarchy structure one item acts as the “root”,
while the other items relate to it as subordinated “family members” (children, grandchildren etc.) (Behrens, 2008).


## Usage

Identify the root member of the dataset. Draw the graphic object its represents, and attach its child elements on the appropriate visual level, for example one step below. Connect directly related elements with each other through a stroke. Continue accordingly with the remaining elements of the dataset. Maintain visually distinct “family levels”, for instance by placing children always below their parents, and siblings on an equal height, respectively with equal visual distance between equal distances of generations (Behrens, 2008).


## Rationale

The tree is the commonly accepted way of displaying family-style structures; constructs of elements that stand in some kind of inheritance relationship to each other. Through the strict placement of different generations on different levels the user can easily identify causal relationships within the data structure.

Especially in connection to computers, tree structures are a somewhat ubiquitous concept of organizing data; an operating system maintains files in a tree, the functions of many applications are arranged hierarchically, just as the content of complex editors. The  majority of websites provides its content in a similar way, so that users of digital media are sort of anticipating information offered in a tree-like fashion: Choosing one of a few main branches in the beginning, the search becomes more detailed the deeper he drills down the tree (Behrens, 2008).
