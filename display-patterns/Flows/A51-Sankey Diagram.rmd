# R Implementation Pattern

Sankey Diagram is a graphic that contains intputs an ouputs, they represent a sum respectively. In such diagrams, it is easy to see representations of the efforts of input and output.

## Data Set

For this example it will be used Data Set called mtcars, this data set is the R default data set this data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

```{r}
head(mtcars)

```

## Dependencies 

> Graphics - default package on R

For this example in graphics it will be used other dependence called Sankey.R
this dependence is hosted in this link:  [https://gist.github.com/aaronberdanier/1423501#file-sankey-r]

> GoogleVis 

## Code example 

### Code Example With Graphics

```{r}
source('Sankey.R')

mpg=mtcars["Datsun 710",1]
hp=mtcars["Datsun 710",4]
cyl=mtcars["Datsun 710",2]
wt= mtcars["Datsun 710",6]
disp=mtcars["Datsun 710",3]
qsec=mtcars["Datsun 710",7]
gear =mtcars["Datsun 710",10]
inputs = c(mpg,disp)
losses = c(qsec,gear,cyl,hp)
unit = "n ="

labels = c("Miles/(US) gallon",
           "Displacement\n",
           "1/4 mile time",
           "Number of forward gears",
           "Number of cylinders",
           "Datsun 710\nGross HP")

SankeyR(inputs,losses,unit,labels)

# Clean up my mess
rm("inputs", "labels", "losses", "SankeyR", "unit")

```

### Code Example With GoogleVis

In this example, a package called GoogleVis google for R is used, this package generates Web graphics can also be used in desktop applications.

```{r}

require(googleVis)
mpg=mtcars["Datsun 710",1]
hp=mtcars["Datsun 710",4]
cyl=mtcars["Datsun 710",2]
wt= mtcars["Datsun 710",6]
disp=mtcars["Datsun 710",3]
qsec=mtcars["Datsun 710",7]
gear =mtcars["Datsun 710",10]
dat <- data.frame(From=c(rep("Miles/(US) gallon",4), rep("Displacement", 4)),
                  To=c(rep(c("1/4 mile time",
                             "Number of forward gears",
                             "Number of cylinders",
                             "Datsun 710 Gross horsepower"))),
                  Weight=c(mpg,gear,cyl,hp))

sk1 <- gvisSankey(dat, from="From", to="To", weight="Weight")
plot(sk1)

```
