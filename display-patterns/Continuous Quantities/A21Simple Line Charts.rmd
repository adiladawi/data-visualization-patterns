# R Implementation Pattern

Simple Line Chart pattern is very easy to implement on R, insomuch as R have a package called graphics in which can to make simple line chart, package graphics is recomended but there are more packages that are not default on R that can be implemented to make Simple Line Chart Pattern. 

Then it shows an example of R pattern implementation.

## Data Set

For this example it will be used Data Set called mtcars, this data set is the R default data set this data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

```{r}
head(mtcars)

```

## Dependencies 
Graphics - default package on R
Ggplot2 
Lattice
## Code example 

### Code Example With Graphics
```{r}
cars <- (mtcars$wt)
plot(cars, type="o", col="blue")
title(main="Cars", col.main="blue", font.main=4)
```
### Code Example With Ggplot
```{r}
head(mtcars)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=mtcars, aes(x=mtcars$wt, y=mtcars$mpg))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_point()

```
### Code Example With Graphics
```{r}
library(lattice)
panel.spline <- function(x, y) {
  panel.xyplot(x, y) 
  panel.loess(x, y) 
}
attach(mtcars)
xyplot(mpg~wt, scales=list(cex=2, col="red"),
       panel=panel.spline)
```
