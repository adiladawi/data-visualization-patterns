# A 2.3: Stacked Area Chart

## Description 

An area chart displays the development of quantitative values over an interval. It resembles a line chart as it uses lines connecting data points with each other. The specific characteristic of the area chart is that the area below the line is filled with a certain color or texture. When more lines are added to the graphic, they are “stacked” on top of the previous line. This makes the area chart a preferred diagram type for displaying several data sets within the same chart with stress on a total magnitude several variables add to. 

## Required Data 

Use stacked area charts for the display of sets of one or more quantitative values observed against a continuous interval, such as time. More than one value per dataset is possible (and even desirable for this type of display), but they should all be scaled identically. The crucial reason why you decide in favor of this display type (and against line charts) is that not only the magnitudes of the single variables count. Instead, the total amount the several variables contribute takes center stage.

## Usage

Create a Cartesian coordinate grid. Label and subdivide the axes according to the value range of your underlying data. Define a color or texture for each of your variables to tell them clearly apart. Display the first set of variables as a line over the interval on the x-axis. With the second variable, for each x-value add the amount of the first variable and draw the data point accordingly, as if to “stack” the data points of the second set on top of the first one. Proceed likewise with the remaining variables until you have a stack of lines. Now fill the areas between two respective lines with the color or texture assigned to the upper line. Make it clearly distinguishable from its neighbors.

## Rationale

Stacked area charts combine the widespread understanding of line charts with the strong visual power of filled areas. While the values of the single variables are often only approximately to tell (since the stacked areas have no common and even measurement base), the total magnitude of the accumulated variables becomes directly visible.
