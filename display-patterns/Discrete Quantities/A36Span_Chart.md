#A 3.6: SPAN CHART


## Description

Use a span chart to display multiple datasets, with each set containing a minimum and a maximum value and only these extreme values being of interest to the observer. In other words, your data table has two variable columns, both applying the same scale and unit. These datasets can also contain more than two values. However, those values “in between” will get lost as only minimum and maximum matter to this representation type (Behrens, 2008).


## Required Data

Use a span chart to display multiple datasets, with each set containing a minimum and a maximum value and only these extreme values being of interest to the observer. In other words, your data table has two variable columns, both applying the same scale and unit. These datasets can also contain more than two values. However, those values “in between” will get lost as only minimum and maximum matter to this representation typ (Behrens, 2008).


## Usage

Create a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. Label and scale the axes appropriately. In your database, determine the minimum and maximum values of each dataset you want to display. For each of these sets, create a bar in the coordinate grid, and resize it in the way that the bottom end of it represents the minimum value, and the top end the maximum value (Behrens, 2008).


## Rationale

The span chart converts potentially large sets of data into slim graphics, leading the user’s attention to the extreme values that matter in this case. This said, it should be kept in mind that this type of display doesn’t tell the user anything about the values in between these two extremes neither about their distribution, nor about average values (Behrens, 2008).

If you need to display more detailed information, you should consider a different representation method instead: The box plot, a  Diagram style widely used in descriptive statisics, allows the reader to identify several key data out of a set of single items:
Besides maximum and minimum values, the graph contains a median marker (displaying the average value), quartile ranges representing the upper and lower 25 percent of items as seen from the median, as well as outliers that significantly deviate from the data set [Benjamini 1988]
